# 3DSpaceSim
This was one of my first (if not the first - I played a lot and recreated this program in Visual Basic and later C and C# - see my [Copernicus](https://github.com/marcfrincu/copernicus) repository) program I wrote back in 2000 to simulate the surrounding sky in 3D. Fully written in Pascal for my Certificate in Informatics in my senior year in highschool. It was a good exercise to learn advanced programming and math skills.
I have not changed any code it it, the program here is as it was back then, in Romanian language, graphics, mouse interaction, and a file to store the data.

## What it can do

- Zoom and rotate around the 3-axis;
- Find stars within a given distance from the Sun/star and draw a line to them;
- The Sun is by default in the center but you can select any other star as the new reference.
